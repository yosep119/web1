<h2>Human Brain 이란 무엇인가?</h2>
The human brain is the central <u>organ</u> of the human <strong>nervous system</strong>, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum.<br> <br> <br>



<p>There are a number of tests and procedures to diagnose conditions involving the nervous system. In addition to the traditional X-ray, a specialized X-ray called a fluoroscopy examines the body in motion, such as blood flowing through arteries, according to the NIH.</p>

<p>Other standard neurological exams include an <a href="https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=dept-medimg-mri"target="_blank" title="html5 specification">MRI</a> (magnetic resonance imaging), CT scan, and an electroencephalogram (EEG), which records the brain's continuous electrical activity. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a procedure that measures cell or tissue metabolism and brain activity to detect tumors or diseased tissue or tumors, the NIH noted.</p>

A spinal tap places a needle into the spinal canal to drain a small amount of cerebral spinal fluid that is tested for infection or other abnormalities, according to the NIH.
